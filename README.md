# Anxiety Catalogue

https://magdihazaa.com/work/anxiety-catalogue/

Using survey data of 50 people talking about their experience with anxiety I tried to make a genuine portrayal of that using only text and sound. I tried the capture the experience of negativity being our default setting, our brains constantly reverting to a state of unease and self-deprecation, where the only way out is to persistently try. Most of the sounds in this project are original and it was a huge part of overcoming the challenge of making this website strictly using the textual data. I created this project with a combination of HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. I also used the MCADGEN npm extension to generate the html page from the survey data.
